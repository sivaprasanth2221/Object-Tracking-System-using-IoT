Object Tracking System using Ultrasonic Sensors and Arduino Nano Every

Project Overview
This project tracks objects in real-time using ultrasonic sensors and controls servo motors to adjust the tracking angle. It is ideal for applications like security, automation, and robotics.

Features
- Real-time object tracking using ultrasonic sensors.
- Dynamic servo motor control to follow object movement.
- Cost-effective and easily scalable design.
  
Components Used
- Arduino Nano Every
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) (2 units)
- Servo Motors (2 units)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable (for programming)
- Power supply (5V)

Pin Configuration
1. TrigPinX: Pin 2 (Ultrasonic X axis)
2. EchoPinX: Pin 3 (Ultrasonic X axis)
3. TrigPinY: Pin 5 (Ultrasonic Y axis)
4. EchoPinY: Pin 6 (Ultrasonic Y axis)
5. ServoPinL: Pin 8 (Left Servo Motor)
6. ServoPinR: Pin 10 (Right Servo Motor)

Working Principle
- Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance and position of an object.
- The readings are processed by the Arduino Nano Every to control the servo motors, adjusting them to track the object in real-time.

Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (for programming the board)
- Ultrasonic sensor library (included in the Arduino IDE)
  
How to Run
1. Connect the components as per the schematic.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino Nano Every using Arduino IDE.
